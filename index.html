    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is James Sarlo, and I am a recent graduate of Franciscan University of Steubenville. 
        I have a Mathematics and Computer Science degree. I currently work for a company called <a href="http://zoommedia.com/us/">ZOOM Media</a>, which provides advertising and music content
        for fitness centers around the world. I currently work in small-town Western PA near Pittsburgh, but am looking to explore the world. This website
        is my experimentation platform by which I can learn new technology, document my projects, show off my skills to recruiters, and share some personal thoughts and experiences.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>I work in IT as a day job, but I'm looking to get into software engineering or possibly freelance work. The programming language I am most familiar with is C++, but I also have experience in Java, C#, Python, R, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
        My interests include, but are not limited to, sustainable energy, cars, Artificial Intelligence, music, literature, and history. As for a career, I would love to be able to work on
        one of the cutting edge problems in Computer Science: self-driving cars. You can reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jsarlo2014">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/jamessarlo">Instagram</a>.
